<span class="i0">As down by the wall he slants&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">On the clearing, brown and bare&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In December’s heat and glare.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The bushmen are big rough boys at the best,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With hearts of a larger growth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But they hide those hearts with a brutal jest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the pain with a reckless oath.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though the Bills and Jims of the bush-bard sing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of their life loves, lost or dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The love of a girl is a sacred thing<br /></span>

<span class="i0">‘I have been happy on western farms. And once, when I first went wrong,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Far out on the southern seas I’ve sailed, and ridden where brumbies roam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And oft, when all on the station failed, I’ve driven the outlaw home.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I’ve spent a cheque in a day and night, and I’ve made a cheque as quick;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I’d give it all for the last half-mile in the race we rode to-day!’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he passed away as the stars came out&mdash;he died as old heroes die&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">They were butterflies&mdash;I always was a common caterpillar,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">You remember when we often had to go without our dinners,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the days when Pride and Hunger fought a finish out within us;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">There’ll be gossip in the ‘circle,’ in the drawing-rooms and gardens;<br /></span>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘Rouseabout’ and ‘picker-up’ are interchangeable terms in above
rhymes, as also ‘boss’ and ‘super’; the shed-name for the latter is
‘Boss-over-the-board.’ The shearer is paid by the hundred, the
rouser by the week. ‘Pink ’em pretty’: to shear clean to the skin.
‘Bell-sheep’: shearers are not supposed to take another sheep out
of pen when ‘Smoke-ho,’ breakfast or dinner bell goes, but some
time themselves to get so many sheep out, and <i>one as the bell
goes</i>, which makes more work for the rouser and entrenches on his
‘smoke-ho,’ as he must leave his ‘board’ clean. Shearers are seldom

<span class="i0">From a slum in Jones’ Alley sloped the Captain of the Push;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he scowled towards the North, and he scowled towards the South,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he hooked his little finger in the corners of his mouth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then his whistle, loud and shrill, woke the echoes of the ‘Rocks,’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a dozen ghouls came sloping round the corners of the blocks.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There was nought to rouse their anger; yet the oath that each one swore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seemed less fit for publication than the one that went before.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_175" id="page_175"></a>{175}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For they spoke the gutter language with the easy flow that comes<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then they spat in turns, and halted; and the one that came behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spitting fiercely on the pavement, called on Heaven to strike him blind.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Let us first describe the captain, bottle-shouldered, pale and thin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he was the beau-ideal of a Sydney larrikin;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">E’en his hat was most suggestive of the city where we live,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a gallows-tilt that no one, save a larrikin, can give;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And he wore his shirt uncollar’d, and the tie correctly wrong;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I think his vest was shorter than should be in one so long.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And the captain crooked his finger at a stranger on the kerb,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Till he gave an introduction&mdash;it was painfully abrupt&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘Here’s the bleedin’ push, me covey&mdash;here’s a (something) from the bush!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Took the rock and&mdash;smash! They only muttered ‘My kerlonial oath!’<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Ere the Bleeders had secured them; yet the captain of the push<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swore a dozen oaths in favour of the stranger from the bush.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Late next morn the captain, rising, hoarse and thirsty from his lair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Called the newly-feather’d Bleeder, but the stranger wasn’t there!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quickly going through the pockets of his ‘bloomin’ bags,’ he learned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the stranger had been through him for the stuff his ‘moll’ had earned;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the language that he muttered I should scarcely like to tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Stars! and notes of exclamation!! blank and dash will do as well).<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In the night the captain’s signal woke the echoes of the ‘Rocks,’<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And the Bleeders soon forgot him; but the captain of the push<br /></span>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Most</span> unpleasantly adjacent to the haunts of lower orders<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood a ‘terrace’ in the city when the current year began,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a notice indicated there were vacancies for boarders<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the middle house, and lodgings for a single gentleman.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, a singular observer could have seen but few attractions<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether in the house, or ‘missus, or the notice, or the street,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But at last there came a lodger whose appearances and actions<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Puzzled Constable M‘Carty, the policeman on the beat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_197" id="page_197"></a>{197}</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He (the single gent) was wasted almost to emaciation,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his features were the palest that M‘Carty ever saw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And these indications, pointing to a past of dissipation,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Greatly strengthened the suspicions of the agent of the law.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He (the lodger&mdash;hang the pronoun!) seemed to like the stormy weather,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the elements in battle kept it up a little late;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet he’d wander in the moonlight when the stars were close together,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Taking ghostly consolation in a visionary state.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He would walk the streets at midnight, when the storm-king raised his banner,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Walk without his old umbrella,&mdash;wave his arms above his head:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or he’d fold them tight, and mutter, in a wild, disjointed manner,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the town was wrapped in slumber and he should have been in bed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_198" id="page_198"></a>{198}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said the constable-on-duty: ‘Shure, Oi wonther phwat his trade is?’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the constable would watch him from the shadow of a wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he never picked a pocket, and he ne’er accosted ladies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the constable was puzzled what to make of him at all.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now, M‘Carty had arrested more than one notorious dodger,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had heard of men afflicted with the strangest kind of fads,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he couldn’t fix the station or the business of the lodger,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who at times would chum with cadgers, and at other times with cads.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the constable would often stand and wonder how the gory<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sheol the stranger got his living, for he loafed the time away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he often sought a hillock when the sun went down in glory,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just as if he was a mourner at the burial of the day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_199" id="page_199"></a>{199}</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Mac. had noticed that the lodger did a mighty lot of smoking,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And could ‘stow away a long ’un,’ never winking, so he could;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And M‘Carty once, at midnight, came upon the lodger poking<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round about suspicious alleys where the common houses stood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet the constable had seen him in a class above suspicion&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seen him welcomed with effusion by a dozen ‘toney gents’&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seen him driving in the buggy of a rising politician<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thro’ the gateway of the member’s toney private residence.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And the constable, off duty, had observed the lodger slipping<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down a lane to where the river opened on the ocean wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where he’d stand for hours gazing at the distant anchor’d shipping,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he never took his coat off, so it wasn’t suicide.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_200" id="page_200"></a>{200}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the constable had noticed that a man who’s filled with loathing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For his selfish fellow-creatures and the evil things that be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will, for some mysterious reason, shed a portion of his clothing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere he takes his first and final plunge into eternity.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And M‘Carty, once at midnight&mdash;be it said to his abasement&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Left his beat and climbed a railing of considerable height,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just to watch the lodger’s shadow on the curtain of his casement<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the little room was lighted in the listening hours of night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, at first the shadow hinted that the substance sat inditing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now it indicated toothache, or the headache; and again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Twould exaggerate the gestures of a dipsomaniac fighting<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those original conceptions of a whisky-sodden brain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_201" id="page_201"></a>{201}</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then the constable, retreating, scratched his head and muttered ‘Sorra<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wan of me can undershtand it. But Oi’ll keep me Oi on him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Divil take him and his tantrums; he’s a lunatic, begorra!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, if he was up to mischief, he’d be sure to douse the glim.’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But M‘Carty wasn’t easy, for he had a vague suspicion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That a ‘skame’ was being plotted; and he thought the matter down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till his mind was pretty certain that the business was sedition,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the man, in league with others, sought to overthrow the Crown.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But, in spite of observation, Mac. received no information<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And was forced to stay inactive, being puzzled for a charge.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the lodger was a madman seemed the only explanation,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tho’ the house would scarcely harbour such a lunatic at large.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_202" id="page_202"></a>{202}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">His appearance failed to warrant apprehension as a vagrant,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tho’ ’twas getting very shabby, as the constable could see;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But M‘Carty in the meantime hoped to catch him in a flagrant<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breach of peace, or the intention to commit a felony.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">(For digression there is leisure, and it is the writer’s pleasure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just to pause a while and ponder on a painful legal fact,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Being forced to say in sorrow, and a line of doubtful measure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That there’s nothing so elastic as the cruel Vagrant Act)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, M‘Carty knew his duty, and was brave as any lion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he dreaded being ‘landed’ in an influential bog&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the chances were he would be if the man he had his eye on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was a person of importance who was travelling <i>incog.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_203" id="page_203"></a>{203}</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Want of sleep and over-worry seemed to tell upon M‘Carty:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was thirsty more than ever, but his appetite resigned;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was previously reckoned as a jolly chap and hearty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the mystery was lying like a mountain on his mind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tho’ he tried his best, he couldn’t get a hold upon the lodger,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the latter’s antecedents weren’t known to the police&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They considered that the ‘devil’ was a dark and artful dodger<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who was scheming under cover for the downfall of the peace.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">’Twas a simple explanation, though M‘Carty didn’t know it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which with half his penetration he might easily have seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>For the object of his dangerous suspicions was a poet,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Who was not so widely famous as he thought he should have been.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_204" id="page_204"></a>{204}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the constable grew thinner, till one morning, ‘little dhramin’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Av the sword of revelation that was leapin’ from its sheath,’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He alighted on some verses in the columns of the <span class="smcap">Frayman</span>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘<i>Wid the christian name an’ surname av the lodger onderneath!</i>’<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now, M‘Carty and the poet are as brother is to brother,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, at least, as brothers should be; and they very often meet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the lonely block at midnight, and they wink at one another&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disappearing down the by-way of a shanty in the street.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the poet’s name you’re asking?&mdash;well, the ground is very tender,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You must wait until the public put the gilt upon the name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till a glorious, sorrow-drowning, and, perhaps, a final ‘bender,’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heralds his triumphant entrance to the thunder-halls of Fame.<br /></span>

<div class="blockquott"><p>BY HENRY LAWSON, Author of “While the Billy Boils;” “When the World
was Wide and Other Verses;” “Verses, Popular and Humorous;” “On the
Track and Over the Sliprails.”</p>

<p><b>The Athenæum</b> (London): “This is a long way the best work Mr. Lawson has
yet given us. These stories are so good that (from the literary point of
view, of course) one hopes they are not autobiographical. As
autobiography they would be good; as pure fiction they are more of an
attainment.”</p>

<p><b>Pall Mall Gazette:</b> “We can see in these rough diamonds the men who have
of late so distinguished themselves at Eland’s River and elsewhere.”</p>

<p><b>The Argus:</b> “More tales of the Joe Wilson series are promised, and this
will be gratifying to Mr. Lawson’s admirers, for on the whole the
sketches are the best work the writer has so far accomplished.”</p>

<p><b>The Academy:</b>&mdash;“I have never read anything in modern English literature
that is so absolutely democratic in tone, so much the real thing, as
<i>Joe Wilson’s Courtship</i>. And so with all Lawson’s tales and sketches.
Tolstoy and Howells, and Whitman and Kipling, and Zola and Hauptmann and
Gorky have all written descriptions of ‘democratic’ life; but none of
these celebrated authors, not even Maupassant himself, has so absolutely
taken us inside the life as do the tales <i>Joe Wilson’s Courtship</i> and <i>A
Double Buggy at Lahey’s Creek</i>, and it is this rare convincing tone of
this Australian writer that gives him a great value. The most casual
‘newspapery’ and apparently artless art of this Australian writer
carries with it a truer, finer, more delicate commentary on life than
all the idealistic works of any of our genteel school of writers.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Francis Thompson</span>, in <b>The Daily Chronicle</b>: “He is a writer of strong and
ringing ballad verse, who gets his blows straight in, and at his best
makes them all tell. He can vignette the life he knows in a few touches,
and in this book shows an increased power of selection.”</p>

<p><b>Academy</b>: “Mr. Lawson’s work should be well known to our readers; for we
have urged them often enough to make acquaintance with it. He has the
gift of movement, and he rarely offers a loose rhyme. Technically, short
of anxious lapidary work, these verses are excellent. He varies
sentiment and humour very agreeably.”</p>

<p><b>New York Evening Journal</b>: “Such pride as a man feels when he has true
greatness as his guest, this newspaper feels in introducing to a million
readers a man of ability hitherto unknown to them. Henry Lawson is his
name.”</p>

<p><b>The Book Lover</b>: “Any book of Lawson’s should be bought and treasured by
all who care for the real beginnings of Australian literature. As a

<p><b>Daily Chronicle</b>: “Will well sustain the reputation its author has
already won as the best writer of Australian short stories and sketches
the literary world knows. Henry Lawson has the art, possessed in such
eminent degree by Mr. J. M. Barrie, of sketching in a character and
suggesting a whole life-story in a single sentence.”</p>

<p><b>Pall Mall Gazette</b>: “The volume now received will do much to enhance the
author’s reputation. There is all the quiet irresistible humour of
Dickens in the description of ‘The Darling River,’ and the creator of
‘Truthful James’ never did anything better in the way of character
sketches than Steelman and Mitchell. Mr. Lawson has a master’s sense of
what is dramatic, and he can bring out strong effects in a few touches.
Humour and pathos, comedy and tragedy, are equally at his command.”</p>

<p><b>Glasgow Herald</b>: “Mr. Lawson must now be regarded as <i>facile princeps</i> in
the production of the short tale. Some of these brief and even slight
sketches are veritable gems that would be spoiled by an added word, and
without a word that can be looked upon as superfluous.”</p>

which every Australian should have on his bookshelves, whether these

established reputation as one of the best among the small and select
cluster of Australian poets.... Mr. Stephens is specially favoured, in
that he not only has at command a vein of true pathos, but he has
moments of real humour. In more than one poem, too, he has made good his
right to be regarded as the poet of brotherhood and the prophet of
federation.”</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
